# google-homepage

In this project I will try to build the Google Homepage from scratch. It should just look like the homepage though, but doesn't have to do work the same way. (Considering links and the search bar).

This is an exercise from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
